## Self Mark
- [ ] Data modelling: Do the data structures reflect the problem domain? (2 mark)  
- [ ] Immutable data and idempotent methods: Is the type system used to prevent incorrect code from being written? (2 mark)  
- [ ] Functional separation: Is the problem broken down into meaning parts? (3 mark)  
- [ ] Loose coupling: Can parts be changed in isolation of each other? (2 mark)  
- [ ] Extensibility: How easy would it be to add, remove, or change functionality? Could a new  mechanic or new content be added by changing data instead of changing code? (2 mark)  
- [ ] Error handling: Are errors detected at appropriate places? Is the user prevented from  entering invalid input and guided toward valid input? (2 mark)  
- [ ] Demonstration of collaborative work on Github. (2 mark)
