# UTS UniViewer - App Development in the iOS Environment Assignment 3

## Purpose
UTS UniViewer is a general purpose iOS Application for students at the University of Technology Sydney which allows students to view and leave reviews for any subject offered by the university, as well as download and view a subject outline from any valid session/year in the app! 

This tool is aimed towards students who want to gather more insight about subjects that they are curious in, allowing them to access an outline even if they arent taking said subject and view reviews left by students who have done the subject

## Feature List:
- [x] Review subjects of your choosing, whether they be subjects that you are currently taking or have taken in the past.
- [x] Have your chosen subjects displayed and saved to your account, as well as their reviews from other UTS students.
- [x] See any review for any subject left by any student - all data is persistent.
- [x] Retrieve a subject outline for your chosen subject and view it **in app** based on your chosen parameters. To do this we pull subject data from the following [public API](https://cis-admin-api.uts.edu.au/subject-outlines/index.cfm/)

## Self Mark
- [x] Data modelling: Do the data structures reflect the problem domain? (2 mark)  
- [x] Immutable data and idempotent methods: Is the type system used to prevent incorrect code from being written? (2 mark)  
- [x] Functional separation: Is the problem broken down into meaning parts? (3 mark)  
- [x] Loose coupling: Can parts be changed in isolation of each other? (2 mark)  
- [x] Extensibility: How easy would it be to add, remove, or change functionality? Could a new  mechanic or new content be added by changing data instead of changing code? (2 mark)  
- [x] Error handling: Are errors detected at appropriate places? Is the user prevented from  entering invalid input and guided toward valid input? (2 mark)  
- [x] Demonstration of collaborative work on Github. (2 mark)
